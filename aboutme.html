    <h1>About me!</h1>
    <p>
      I am from Mexico, the north of Mexico actually. I have lived here my whole
      life, I am now 23 years old, soon to be 24 by the end of the year, and my
      new goal is to become a junior fullStack developer by the end of this
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my whole career I kinda ran away from programing, it felt like it
      was just too much for me and that I could never achieve somenthing like
      this. But I started wondering... why, I can do this stuff too.
      Hopefully...
    </p>
